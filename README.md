# Elysium Engine
An open source text adventure engine written in Java (Specifically JDK 23).
Its being written in the eclipse IDE, other editors and IDEs may have issues.
Also this is a long term project of mine since I started learning java and I just a had a long break from working on it due to my college classes being busy. There may be inconsistencies or issues with what has been implemented already.
